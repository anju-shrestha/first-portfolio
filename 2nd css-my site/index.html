                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>I started cooking at very young age. Because our mother raised us single handed so she didn't have so much time to do households. As a first child of family it was my responsbility to help my mother, so I started to handle kitchen section. Before, cooking was just a responsbility but by the time it's became my hobby then skill. Now I love cooking for others. It's makes me happy. </p>

                <h3>Sewing & Stitching</h3>
                <p>My mother was not free to sew doll's clothes and play with me. So I was taught to make doll's clothes by my aunts. By the time when I was in my teen I was making my own clothes by hand, which came useful when got sewing machine. Now I improve my sewing skills so I can make anything which my home and family needs. It is cheaper and creative too. I love it.</p>
